## Docker Compose File Mapping

The Docker Compose files are organized by node and category to enable modular deployment and service management. Each compose file sits within a parent folder reflecting its category for clarity.

### Node #2 (goingmerry)

| Category | File Path | Services |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Networking** | `goingmerry/networking/docker-compose-nginx.yml` | Nginx Proxy Manager, AdGuard Home, Cloudflare Tunnel |
| **Management** | `goingmerry/management/docker-compose-portainer.yml` | Portainer Controller |
| **Security** | `goingmerry/security/docker-compose-security.yml` | Authentik, Wazuh, CrowdSec, Suricata, Vaultwarden |
| **Monitoring** | `goingmerry/monitoring/docker-compose-monitoring.yml` | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Uptime Kuma, Watchtower |
| **Automation** | `goingmerry/automation/docker-compose-automation.yml` | n8n |

### Node #1 (thousandsunny)

| Category | File Path | Services |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Infrastructure** | `thousandsunny/infra/docker-compose-gitea.yml` | Gitea, Duplicati, Nextcloud AIO |
| **Media** | `thousandsunny/media/docker-compose-media.yml` | Plex, Jellyfin, Immich, Kavita, ARR Suite, Overseerr |
| **Torrent** | `thousandsunny/torrent/docker-compose-torrent.yml` | qBittorrent, Deluge |
| **AI** | `thousandsunny/ai/docker-compose-ai.yml` | Ollama, Ollama WebUI |

### Usage

To deploy a specific category of services:
```bash
# Example: Deploy monitoring stack on Node #2
cd goingmerry/monitoring
docker-compose up -d

# Example: Deploy media services on Node #1
cd thousandsunny/media
docker-compose up -d
```

Each compose file contains placeholder configurations that can be customized with proper environment variables, volumes, and network settings.

## üåê External Access & Security

### Cloudflare Tunnel Integration
SunnyLabX uses **Cloudflare Tunnel** for secure external access, eliminating the need for:
- **Port forwarding** on your router
- **Exposing your public IP address**
- **Opening firewall ports** to the internet
- **Dynamic DNS** services
- **Self-signed certificates** or certificate management

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Trust Security**: All traffic passes through Cloudflare's secure edge network
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in protection against distributed attacks
- **Automatic SSL**: Cloudflare handles SSL/TLS termination and certificates
- **Global Performance**: Cloudflare's edge network provides fast global access
- **Private Network**: Your home lab remains completely private from the internet
- **Authentication**: Integration with Cloudflare Access for additional security layers

**Setup Requirements:**
- Cloudflare account with a registered domain
- Cloudflare Tunnel configured to point to your Nginx Proxy Manager
- Domain DNS managed through Cloudflare

---

## Ansible Infrastructure Automation

SunnyLabX includes comprehensive Ansible automation for infrastructure deployment and configuration management. The Ansible setup provides automated installation and configuration of all required packages, security settings, and Docker infrastructure across both nodes.

### üìÅ Ansible Structure

```
ansible/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hosts.ini              # Inventory with node definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playbook.yml           # Base system setup and configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-playbook.yml    # Docker installation and configuration
```

### üèóÔ∏è Node Configuration

**Node Definitions:**
- **node1** (thousandsunny.lab.local) - Application & Content Hub
- **node2** (goingmerry.lab.local) - Management & Control Hub

**Host Groups:**
- `[thousandsunny]` - Node #1 application workloads
- `[goingmerry]` - Node #2 management services
- `[docker_nodes]` - All Docker-enabled nodes

### üöÄ Deployment Workflow

#### Step 1: Prepare Inventory
Edit `ansible/hosts.ini` to match your environment:
```ini
node1 ansible_host=your-node1-ip ansible_user=your-user
node2 ansible_host=your-node2-ip ansible_user=your-user
```

#### Step 2: Base System Setup
Deploy base packages, security configuration, and system setup:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml
```

**What this installs:**
- Essential packages: curl, wget, git, htop, build tools
- Security tools: aide, lynis, ufw firewall
- System utilities: openssh-server, samba, smartmontools
- Development tools: python3-pip, pipx
- Repository: Clones SunnyLabX to `/opt/sunnylabx`

#### Step 3: Docker Infrastructure
Install and configure Docker on all nodes:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/docker-playbook.yml
```

**What this configures:**
- Docker engine and Docker Compose
- User permissions for Docker management
- Python libraries for container automation
- Docker service startup and testing

#### Step 4: Service Deployment
Navigate to service categories and deploy:
```bash
# On Node #2 (Management)
ssh user@goingmerry.lab.local
cd /opt/sunnylabx/goingmerry/networking
docker-compose up -d

# On Node #1 (Applications)  
ssh user@thousandsunny.lab.local
cd /opt/sunnylabx/thousandsunny/media
docker-compose up -d
```

### üîß Advanced Usage

#### Selective Deployment
Use tags for specific components:
```bash
# Install only base packages
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --tags "packages,base"

# Configure only security/firewall
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --tags "security,firewall"

# Docker verification only
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/docker-playbook.yml --tags "verify,test"
```

#### Target Specific Nodes
Deploy to individual nodes or groups:
```bash
# Management node only
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --limit goingmerry

# Application nodes only
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --limit thousandsunny
```

#### Check Mode (Dry Run)
Preview changes without applying:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --check
```

### üîí Security Features

- **SSH Protection**: OpenSSH rules configured before firewall activation
- **UFW Firewall**: Automatic configuration with service-specific ports
- **User Management**: Proper Docker group permissions
- **Package Security**: Only essential packages installed
- **Connection Safety**: SSH connections remain uninterrupted during deployment

### üè¢ Node-Specific Configuration

**Node #2 (goingmerry) - Management Hub:**
- **Firewall Ports**: 9000 (Portainer), 3000 (Grafana), 9090 (Prometheus), 3100 (Loki), 8080 (NPM), 5000 (n8n)
- **Data Directories**: Management service data persistence
- **Role**: Central monitoring, security, and cluster management

**Node #1 (thousandsunny) - Application Hub:**
- **Firewall Ports**: 32400 (Plex), 8096 (Jellyfin), 3001 (Immich), ARR suite, download clients, AI services
- **Data Directories**: Media storage, download management, application data
- **Role**: Content services, storage, development, and AI workloads

### üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

```bash
# Update system packages
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml --tags "packages"

# Restart Docker services
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/docker-playbook.yml --tags "services"

# Full redeployment
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/playbook.yml
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/docker-playbook.yml
```

### üìã Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **SSH Connection**: Ensure SSH keys are configured and accessible
- **Docker Group**: Log out/in after first run for Docker permissions
- **Firewall**: SSH rules applied before UFW activation prevents lockout
- **Permissions**: Repository cloned with correct user ownership

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Test connectivity
ansible all -i ansible/hosts.ini -m ping

# Check Docker status
ansible docker_nodes -i ansible/hosts.ini -m shell -a "docker --version"

# Verify services
ansible all -i ansible/hosts.ini -m shell -a "systemctl status docker"
```
