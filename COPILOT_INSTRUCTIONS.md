## Rules for this project

- Each node has its purposes.
- Never use "Version" in any future docker-compose.yml scripts. This is obsolete on ALL nodes.
- Docker compose is the correct syntax
- The nodes should be able to speak to each other.
- ThousandSunny media drives are mounted at /mnt/hdd-1 /mnt/hdd-2 /mnt/hdd-3 & /mnt/hdd-4 - use named mounts - simple structure
- GoingMerry has ThousandSunny's drives mounted via NFS at /mnt/HDD1-4 respectively.
- Cloudflare tunnels + WAF are used for external access
- ISP Restrictions: No port forwarding; Unable to change DNS server via router interface (restricted)
- Two branches will exist, the base branch, with all of the placeholder values and dir structure & main branch with real configs.
- The docker networks should be set up logically.
